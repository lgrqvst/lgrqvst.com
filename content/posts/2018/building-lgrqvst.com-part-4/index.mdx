My current thinking is to have five basic design templates to begin with, as follows:

#### Home page

Top page. What you're faced with when you go to lgrqvst.com. Should have a _logo_ and a _general description_ of what the site is, _navigation_ with links to static pages, the _latest blog posts_ and _art things_, some methods to access _earlier content_ (category listings, e.g.), _footer_ with footer stuff.

#### Static page

The About page, Contact page and (possibly) a Now page. Should have the _logo_, _navigation_, _page content_ and _footer_.

#### List page

For all the things belonging to a category, tag, theme, motif, etc. Should have the _logo_, _navigation_, maybe a brief _description of the taxonomy term_, relevant content in a _scannable list_, and the _footer_.

#### Single blog post

When reading a single blog post. Should have the _logo_, _navigation_, _post content_ and _footer_. Maybe also include _links_ to the next and previous posts in the same category? And/or related content?

#### Single 'art' thing

When viewing a single thing I made (based on the category or post type of the content item). Should have the _logo_, _navigation_, _the thing_, and the _footer_. The presentation of the thing depends on the type of the thing. Again, maybe _links_ to similar content? This should basically be similar to the single blog post template but be customized to put the art thingy front and center.
