Hello! I'm Johan Lagerqvist, a web designer/front end developer living and working in Osaka, Japan. I enjoy making things.

I'm originally from Gothenburg, Sweden, but I've lived in Japan since 2016.

I use he/him pronouns.

This section might be expanded upon in the future, but for now, if you're really curious, [contact](/contact) me.
