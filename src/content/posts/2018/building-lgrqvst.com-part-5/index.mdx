I don't have any mockups or psd files with a thought-out design for this site, but I do have a few ideas I want to make happen.

I want it to be overall a light site, and I want to have a low-key textured background, like a light paper texture. I want the body text to be in a serif font, and I will probably set headings in a sans-serif font. I want the site to be mostly black and white, with large images and splashes of color here and there providing some contrast.

I also know I want to use CSS Grid. I don't know that the layout I have in mind _requires_ using Grid, but it makes things easier. It's also just a great opportunity to learn more and try a few things.

Honestly, that's pretty much all I have at the outset of this thing. We'll see how it goes, and how things change underway.
