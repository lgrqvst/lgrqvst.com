Here's some of what needs doing to bring this ship to port. There's probably more that should go here that I've failed to realize is missing..

## Before Release

- [x] Finish site (mostly)
- [x] Write post

## After Release

- [ ] Tackle Lighthouse, Checkbot, etc.
- [ ] Run the site through some accessibility tests and patch where necessary
- [ ] Check if user prefers reduced motion and if they do donâ€™t animate shit
- [ ] On mobile: Clickable overlay under nav menu to close menu
- [ ] Move styles to separate folder for better organization
- [ ] Make Figure and Lede and the standard Gatsby Link into mdx shortcodes for easier use
- [ ] Set up RSS feed

- [ ] Put self portrait on About page

### Fancy Stuff

- [ ] Add transition link
- [ ] Set up a link wrapper using transition link
- [ ] Animate page transitions (css animations)
- [ ] Implement that canvas idea I had

### When It Comes Up

- [ ] More robust table styling
- [ ] Figure out mobile solution for tables
- [ ] Image credit for header images
- [ ] Pull quotes
- [ ] Set correct font in code blocks

### Styling

- [ ] ul.contains-task-list (style the actual checkboxes to use something custom)
- [ ] Make /tags page look prettier
- [ ] Make /categories page look prettier

### Bugs

- [ ] Figure out what's causing the error during initialization, and see out if it's important
